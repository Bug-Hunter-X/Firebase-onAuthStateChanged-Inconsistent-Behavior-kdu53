# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener. The listener sometimes fails to reflect real-time authentication state changes, especially under less-than-ideal network conditions or rapid authentication transitions. 

The `authBug.js` file contains a sample application that showcases the inconsistent behavior. The `authSolution.js` file provides a solution to mitigate the issue.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (`npm install`).
3. Run the application.
4. Observe the behavior under different network conditions and with repeated login/logout actions.

## Solution
The solution presented in `authSolution.js` involves implementing additional logic to ensure the listener updates properly.  It may include handling network errors, debouncing rapid authentication changes, or using a combination of listeners.
